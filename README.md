# CS 455 Introduction into Distributed Systems
### This repository holds 3 assignments that showcase the work of the semester

Go into any of these folders to see the full project description along with followup written questions.

#### **HW1**
* Constructing a logical overlay over a distributed set of nodes, and then computing
shortest paths using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to route packets in the system.

#### **HW2**
* Design a server that can handle large amounts of network traffic working with micro batches to process data by implementing a thread pool

#### **HW3**
* Given a large dataset of the Million Song Dataset (https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) , Create a MapReduce Job that would help analyze fields of interest. An example would be what defines an _average song_?
* Dataset operated on was approximately ~220 GB when working with a refined data set for the class
